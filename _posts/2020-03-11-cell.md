# Elementary cellular automata : an implementation in Java
Because I'm fascinated by the concept of *emergence*.

## What is a cellular automata ? 

A cellular automata is a group of cells evolving according to some strict and pre-defined rules. 

Imagine the cells of your body. They can be in either two states : 
- Alive (1)
- Dead (0)

That's the same for the cells of a CA (cellular automata). In general, we represent a living cell with by a **1** and a dead cell by **0**.

Now let's say we have this group of cells : 

> ```00100```

That represents 5 cells, 4 are dead and one is alive. 

Now so far this seems pretty boring and not really interesting. Let's make it a bit more dynamic. 

As I said before, we are going to make this group of cells evolve according to certain rules. 

The general principle of CA is that **the evolution of a cell depends on its neighbours**.

Let's take for instance the **rule 90**.
This rule says that a cell will evolve to 1 if one *and only one* of its neighbors. In every other case, the cell will evolve to 0 (it will die ).

Applying this rule to our group of cells, we get this evolution : ( by the way : cells that have only one neighbor, i.e. the cells on the edges, don't change state)
> ```00100``` â†’ ```01010```

Let's break this evolution down : 

1. The first cell is on the edge. It stays ```0```.
2. The second cell has ```0```and ```1``` as neighbors. It has only one alive neighbor, so it changes to ```1```.
3. The third cell (the only ```1```) has two zeros as neighbors : it doesn't change.
4. The fourth cell is surrounded by ```1```and ```0``` : it evolves to ```1```.
5. Like the first cell, the fifth cell is the edge. It also stays ```0```.

That is one iteration of the evolution process.

Let's now iterate further, starting with a larger group of cells and display the evolution vertically :

> "00000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000000000010100000000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000000000101010000000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000000001010101000000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000000010101010100000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000000101010101010000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000001010101010101000000000000000000",
"00000000000000000010101010101010100000000000000000",
"00000000000000000101010101010101010000000000000000",
"00000000000000001010101010101010101000000000000000",
"00000000000000010101010101010101010100000000000000",
"00000000000000101010101010101010101010000000000000",
"00000000000001010101010101010101010101000000000000"

The result above used the Rule 250. If you look closely, you'll notice a shape appears, like a triangle.

That's where elementary CA gets really interesting : it creates some structures/shapes from some fairly simples. 

## My code 

Knowing all of that, I wanted to make a piece of code that would generate those kind of evolutions for me.

I'll sum up my code here.

Starting with a Object-Oriented mindset, I tried to represent the "phenomena" with objects. 
* I made a class representing a cell, another for a group of cells (the class `Row` in my code), and then a `Plan` to store the evolution on a grid. 
* For the dynamic part, I created the classes `Generator` (to generate the initial group of cells) and `Iterator` (to compute the evolution)
* Finally, I implemented the rules, again with classes (I came the question that choice later though). I created an interface to make sure every rule that I would implement is compatible and can be used by the rest of the code. 
I tried to find a formula for each rule so I wouldn't have to specify the output state for the 8 combinations possibles of set of 3 cells. 
For instance, the rule 30 as the formula `cell left is 1 XOR cell right is 1` ([this article](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-2-1--cellular-automaton-rules-as-formulas/) ont Wolfram Science was helpful). 

Once I had all that, I could generate some nice images to show the "trace" of the evolution of some cells. I created the class `ImageCreator` that writes, from a object of type `Plan`, a BMP image, where each pixel represents the state of a cell.

The result, with the Rule 90, is this :
